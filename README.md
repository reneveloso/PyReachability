**Fast graph reachability methods with a C++17 core and an ergonomic Python API.**

A *reachability query* asks: given a directed graph and two vertices `u` and `v`, is there
a directed path from `u` to `v`? PyReachability packages a representative, best-in-class set
of reachability **indexing methods** under a single, common interface — so you can build an
index once and answer millions of queries fast, and swap methods to fit your graph's
size/memory/query-time trade-off.

The library has a high-performance **C++17 core** exposed through **Cython** (C++ mode), an
**extensible method catalog** (each method is a plug-in implementing one interface), and a
reproducible, catalog-driven benchmark harness (`benchmarks/run_benchmark.py`). It accompanies a *Software Impacts* article.

> **Status:** v0.1.0 — all six v1 methods implemented and tested: the **BFS/DFS** baseline,
> **GRAIL** (interval labels + label-guided search), **FELINE** (2D dominance drawing),
> **PLL** (2-hop labeling), and the **TC** / **Tree Cover** transitive-closure baselines
> (for small/medium graphs). See the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for what's next.

## Installation

From source (a C++17 compiler and CMake ≥ 3.15 are required to build):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reneveloso/PyReachability.git
cd PyReachability
pip install .
```

For development (editable install + test extras):

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

Pre-built wheels on PyPI (`pip install pyreachability`, no compiler needed) are planned for a
later milestone.

## Quickstart

```python
import numpy as np
from pyreachability import Graph, BFSDFS

# Build a graph from a NumPy edge list: edges 0->1, 1->2, 2->0 (a cycle), 3 isolated.
src = np.array([0, 1, 2], dtype=np.int32)
dst = np.array([1, 2, 0], dtype=np.int32)
g = Graph.from_edges(src, dst, num_nodes=4)

# Pick a method, build its index, then query.
idx = BFSDFS()
idx.build(g)

idx.query(0, 2)        # True  (0 -> 1 -> 2)
idx.query(0, 3)        # False (3 is unreachable)
idx.query(3, 3)        # True  (reachability is reflexive)

# Batch queries: (M, 2) int array -> (M,) bool array.
pairs = np.array([[0, 2], [2, 0], [0, 3]], dtype=np.int32)
idx.query_batch(pairs) # array([ True,  True, False])
```

`from_edges` also accepts a single `(E, 2)` array of `[u, v]` rows:

```python
edges = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]], dtype=np.int32)
g = Graph.from_edges(edges, num_nodes=4)
```

Load a graph from a file (`.gz` is decompressed transparently):

```python
g = Graph.from_file("graph.txt", fmt="edgelist")        # one "u v" edge per line
g = Graph.from_file("graph.scc.gra.gz", fmt="gra")      # GRAIL/GREACH adjacency format
```

Export the edges back out (inverse of `from_edges`, reconstructed from CSR):

```python
src, dst = g.to_edges()
```

Discover available methods dynamically through the catalog:

```python
from pyreachability import catalog
catalog.methods()          # ['3hop', 'bfl', 'bfsdfs', 'chaincover', 'dl', 'dual', 'feline', 'ferrari', 'grail', 'gripp', 'hl', 'ip', 'optchain', 'oreach', 'pathhop', 'pathtree', 'pll', 'preach', 'sspi', 'tc', 'tfl', 'tol', 'treecover', 'twohop']
Method = catalog.get("bfsdfs")
idx = Method()
```

A runnable version of this walkthrough lives in [`examples/quickstart.py`](examples/quickstart.py).

## Methods

Every method implements the same [`ReachabilityIndex`](src/pyreachability/base.py) interface
(`build` / `query` / `query_batch` / `index_size_bytes`) and is registered in the catalog.
A method only enters the library if it has a peer-reviewed publication.

These span one+ method per index class of the CSUR 2025 survey, plus the baselines. The
catalog will grow to cover the survey's full plain-reachability list — see
[`docs/methods.md`](docs/methods.md) for the source-backed coverage map.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for how the pieces fit together and how to
add a new method to the catalog, and [`docs/AI_GUIDE.md`](docs/AI_GUIDE.md) for contributor
conventions, the method inclusion policy, and verified references.

## Roadmap

The library is built in milestones, each producing working, tested software:

1. **Foundation** ✅ — build system, CSR graph, SCC condensation, catalog, `BFSDFS` oracle,
   property-based tests, CI.
2. **Representative methods** ✅ — `GRAIL`, `TC`, `TreeCover`, `FELINE`, `PLL` (one+ per index
   class of the survey, plus the baselines).
3. **Benchmark harness + datasets** ✅ — `benchmarks/run_benchmark.py` compares build time,
   index size, and query time across all methods vs the BFS/DFS oracle on standard DAGs
   (`bash benchmarks/fetch_datasets.sh`).
4. **Comprehensive catalog** — implement the remaining **plain-reachability indexes of the
   CSUR 2025 survey** (Table 1). The method list is taken from a peer-reviewed survey, not
   chosen ad hoc — see [`docs/methods.md`](docs/methods.md) for the full coverage map.
5. **Docs site, PyPI wheels, Zenodo DOI.**

Label-constrained / path-constrained reachability (edge-labeled graphs, the survey's Table 2)
is a planned later extension.

## Benchmarks

```bash
bash benchmarks/fetch_datasets.sh                     # standard SIGMOD'08 DAGs -> benchmarks/data/
python benchmarks/run_benchmark.py benchmarks/data/*.gra --csv results.csv
```

The harness builds every catalog method on each graph and reports construction time, index size,
and average query time on random pairs, checking each method against the BFS/DFS oracle. Methods
with super-linear construction are capped to smaller graphs (shown as `skip`); a tiny all-methods
graph can be generated with `python benchmarks/make_synthetic.py`.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"     # build + install with test deps
pytest -v                    # Python test suite (incl. property-based tests)

# C++ unit tests (doctest):
cmake -S . -B build-cpp -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build-cpp --target cpp_tests
./build-cpp/cpp_tests
```

CI runs the full suite on Linux/macOS/Windows across Python 3.9–3.13.
