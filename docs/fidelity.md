# Fidelity to the source publications

PyReachability aims to be a *faithful* implementation of each published method: same algorithmic
idea, same index semantics, same query answers. **Every method is validated for exact correctness
against the BFS/DFS oracle** (property-based tests, hundreds of random graphs each), so no method
ever returns a wrong reachability answer.

Where an implementation departs from the paper, the departure is one of three kinds:

- **Faithful** — the construction and the produced index match the paper (up to tie-breaking).
- **(B) Speed-only** — the produced index / query answers are equivalent to the paper, but a
  construction or query *subroutine* is the simpler textbook version rather than the paper's
  engineered one (slower, but same result). Often the paper itself offers the simpler option.
- **(A) Index differs** — the produced index differs in *size/structure* from the paper's
  (queries still exact), because a construction *choice* (which spanning tree, which dummy
  scheme, which parameter) was simplified.

This page documents every (A) and (B) deviation so users know exactly what they get. Methods not
listed (BFS/DFS, TC, Tree Cover, GRAIL, FELINE, PLL, BFL, Chain Cover, TOL, DL) are faithful.

## Notes per deviation

**2-Hop (Cohen, Halperin, Kaplan, Zwick, 2003).** The paper casts minimum 2-hop as a set cover and
selects, each round, the center whose center-graph has the densest subgraph, approximated by the
linear-time 2-approximation (drop the min-degree vertex, keep the densest snapshot). We implement
exactly that approximation. We rebuild all center graphs every round instead of maintaining them
incrementally, so construction is slower — but minimum 2-hop is NP-hard and its construction is
famously expensive in the literature (PLL/TFL/DL/TOL exist precisely as cheaper heuristics), so this
is the method's known character, not a change to the produced cover.

**3-Hop (Jin, Xiang, Ruan, Fuhry, 2009).** Construction = TC contour + greedy factorization whose
core is a densest-subgraph search. We use the paper's §4.3 method: the densest subgraph is
approximated by the **rank subgraph** (Def. 7 — the l-core/degeneracy core, a 2-approximation by
Lemma 1), and the per-round selection follows Algorithm 2 / Theorem 3 — the chain-center bipartite
graphs are held in a rank-ordered max-heap and the maximum-rank one is chosen each round, with ranks
lazily recomputed over the uncovered contour pairs. The only remaining deviation is query-side: a
per-chain anchor segment lookup rather than the paper's O(log²) structure. The survey notes 3-Hop's
indexing cost is inherently high ("less applicable" to large graphs).

**HL (Jin & Wang, 2013).** Faithful. The recursive reachability backbone is discovered by FastCover
(Jin, Ruan, Dey & Yu, *SCARAB*, SIGMOD 2012) at the paper's default locality threshold ε=2: the
one-side condition (SCARAB Lemma 5) covers every distance-ε pair through a backbone member within ε
hops on each side, with the recommended (in-degree × out-degree) selection order. Backbone edges keep
pairs within distance ε+1; the core graph is labeled with a vertex-id 2-hop and labels propagate down
by Formulas 4–5 (the ⌈ε/2⌉-hop neighbours plus the nearest-backbone label sets Bout^ε / Bin^ε). ε is
exposed as a constructor parameter (`HL(eps=...)`, default 2).

**O'Reach (Hanauer, Schulz, Trummer, 2021).** Faithful. Forward/backward topological levels,
weakly-connected components (Observation B2), `t` extended topological orderings started from
sources (Observations B4, T1–T6), and `k` supportive vertices with full R⁺/R⁻ (Observations S1–S3)
are all implemented, and the constant-time tests run in the paper's prescribed order (B5/B6 → S1 →
first ordering → S2/S3 → remaining orderings → B2). Supportive-vertex selection follows the paper's
most-successful strategy: candidates are the vertices on slim forward/backward levels (≤ `h` each),
capped at `kp` and filled at random from central forward levels, then the top-`k` by |R⁺(v)|·|R⁻(v)|.
The inconclusive-query fallback is the paper's pruning bidirectional BFS (each newly seen vertex is
tested with the observations: positive ⇒ answer yes, negative ⇒ prune). Defaults match the paper
(k=16, p=75, h=8, t=4).

**Spanning structure per paper (verified).** The tree-cover-family methods differ in which tree the
*authors* use, so we follow each one:
- **Tree Cover (Agrawal, 1989)** and **Path-Hop (Cai & Poon, 2010)** use Agrawal's *optimum tree
  cover* (Path-Hop reuses Agrawal's multi-interval labeling). We build exactly that (shared
  `optimal_tree_parent`: each node's tree parent is the in-neighbour with the largest predecessor
  set). Faithful.
- **Tree+SSPI (Chen et al., 2005)** builds its tree-cover by a *depth-first traversal*; we use a DFS
  tree-cover too. Faithful tree; the only deviation is that we store each vertex's own non-tree
  predecessors and resolve the paper's predecessor *inheritance* at query time (same answers).
- **Dual-labeling (Wang et al., 2006)** uses "a spanning tree" (no specific algorithm mandated; we
  use DFS) over the §5 *minimal-equivalent-graph* (the unique transitive reduction of the DAG), to
  shrink the non-tree edge set `t`. Queries now use the paper's Dual-I O(1) TLC counter: the count
  function `N(x,y)` is precomputed on a grid (columns = distinct link x-coordinates, rows = gaps
  between distinct link break-points), and `N(a_u,pre_v) - N(b_u,pre_v) > 0` is evaluated by two O(1)
  grid look-ups after snapping coordinates (Sec. 3.2-3.3). Faithful.
- **Path-Tree (Jin et al., 2011)** uses an *Edmonds maximum-weight* SP-tree over the weighted
  path-graph; we build exactly that (Chu-Liu/Edmonds with the paper's MinPathIndex weights
  `w_{Pi→Pj}=|Pi[→u]|`, virtual-root spanning forest). The remaining deviations are query-side only:
  cover reachability uses all edges of a tree path-pair instead of the *minimal equivalent edge set*
  (reachability-equivalent — and the per-vertex residual `Rc` is domination-minimised regardless, so
  the stored index is unaffected), and the residual is scanned linearly instead of the paper's
  O(log²k) gridding query.

**Ferrari (Seufert et al., 2013).** Faithful. The tree cover uses the paper's heuristic (each
vertex's parent is the in-neighbour with the highest topological-order number). Both indexing
variants are implemented, unified by the constant `c≥1`: `c=1` is Ferrari-L (per-vertex budget
`|I(v)|≤k`); `c>1` is Ferrari-G (Algorithm 2 — deferred merging with a `ck`-interval cover and a
degree min-heap restricting nodes to a `k`-cover once the global budget `B=kn` is exceeded; default
`c=4`). The optimal `k`-interval cover keeps the largest gaps as separators (Def. 3). Pruning uses
the GRAIL topological level filter and seed-based pruning (`seeds` max-degree seeds, default 32; the
`S⁺/S⁻` bitsets give the positive cut `S⁺(s)∩S⁻(t)≠∅⇒reachable` and negative cut "a seed reaches s
but not t ⇒ unreachable"). The only remaining deviation is query-side: the approximate-interval
fallback is a guided DFS rather than the paper's plain recursive expansion (same answers).

**GRIPP (Trißl & Leser, 2007).** Faithful. The hop technique plus the paper's advanced relative-
position pruning (Sec. 4.2): hop nodes are expanded in ascending order-tree position via a min-heap,
and each candidate hop node `h` is pruned against the set `U` of already-used hop ranges by the four
cases of Fig. 4 — (a) already used / (b) `h`'s tree instance inside some `u∈U` ⇒ skip `h`; (c) some
`u∈U` nested inside `RIS(h)` ⇒ skip that sub-range during the scan; (d) sibling ⇒ full scan.

**IP (Wei, Yu, Lu, 2014).** Faithful. The k-min-wise permutation labels plus both additional labels
of Sec. 6: the **Level label** (forward `Lup` and backward `Ldown` topological levels — negative
cuts) and the **Huge-Vertex label** `Lhv(v)` (Algorithm 3: up to `h` largest-out-degree vertices
with out-degree > `µ` that reach `v`). During the DFS, at a huge current vertex `c`: `c∈Lhv(v)` ⇒
reachable; `c∉Lhv(v)` with `Lhv(v)` not full, or `c` outranking its smallest member by out-degree, ⇒
unreachable (Algorithm 4 lines 4–7). Defaults `h=5, µ=100` (the paper's).

**PReaCH (Merz & Sanders, 2014).** Faithful. Contraction-hierarchy ordering, forward/backward
topological levels (Lemma 2), and all of the single-DFS range cuts: the DFS interval `[φ,φ̂]`
(Lemmas 3–4), the largest reachable range outside the subtree `ptree` (Lemma 5, positive), the
smallest reachable DFS number `φ_min` (Lemma 6, negative), and the empty range just left of `v`
`φ_gap` (Lemma 7, negative). All ranges are derived from a single DFS per direction and applied
aggressively (constant-time block and bidirectional search) for both forward and backward.

**Optimal Chain Cover (Chen & Chen, 2008).** The produced index is identical to the paper's: the
*minimum* chain decomposition (verified to equal the Dilworth width). The maximum matching uses the
**Hopcroft-Karp** algorithm (O(e√n)) — the matching algorithm the authors specify. We run it over
the full reachability bipartite graph rather than building their stratified bipartite graphs with
virtual nodes (a construction that reduces the edge count); same minimum number of chains, same index.
